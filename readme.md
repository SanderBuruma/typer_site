# Typer Website
## Intro
Really it's just a generic name. A website intended to be similar to typeracer where you can practice typing.
## Installation
Use one of the following steps. Both will set up a default `admin` user which will have the `admin` password.
### Linux:
```sh
git clone (url)
cd (folder)
chmod +x ./first_install.sh
./first_install.sh
```
### Windows (using PowerShell):
```ps1
git clone (url)
cd (folder)
first_install.ps1
```

## Book uploading
There are some text files provided in `typer/books` which you can upload upon logging in, or uyou can make your own by putting together *.md files which are laid out with h1 # and h2 ## headings (no other tags are supported). All *.md book files must start with a # and ## tag

## Text Selection
Books are selected through markdown files which are prepared in advance using only headings, (chapters) subheadings (parts) and individual lines (lines...)
